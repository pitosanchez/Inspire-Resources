# Kidney Transplant Overview

## What is a kidney transplant?

A kidney transplant is a treatment option for you if your kidneys are not working well enough on their own. This is called kidney failure, also called end stage kidney disease or end stage renal disease. It is a surgery to give a person with kidney failure (the recipient) a healthy kidney from someone else (the donor).

## Why should I consider getting a transplant?

If you have kidney failure, a kidney transplant can help you feel better and live longer compared to a lifetime on dialysis. It may be a good treatment option for you because it can:

### Improve your quality of life

While a kidney transplant is a major surgery and can seem scary, there can be many positive lifestyle changes. You may be able to return to the life you lived before kidney failure. You will no longer need dialysis and have fewer food and drink limits (restrictions), but it will still be important to keep a healthy weight and eat healthy foods.

### Increase your chance of living longer

Studies show that people who get a kidney transplant have a higher chance of living longer than people who stay on dialysis. On average:

- People who are on dialysis have a 40% chance of living after 5 years with kidney failure.
- People who get a kidney transplant have a 80% chance of living after 5 years with kidney failure.

## When is the right time to get a kidney transplant?

The right time for you to get a kidney transplant may be different from others. Your doctor will work with you to decide the right time for you to get a transplant. If possible, the best time to get a transplant is before you need dialysis, which is called a preemptive transplant. This is different from an early transplant, which is a transplant that occurs very soon after you start dialysis.

Doctors decide the best timing for a kidney transplant based on your eGFR and results of your transplant evaluation:

### eGFR Test

Estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR) is a measure of how well your kidneys filter and remove waste products. Your doctor will use your results from the eGFR blood test to help decide when to refer you for evaluation for a transplant. A normal eGFR is 90 or more. You can be placed on the waitlist for a kidney transplant as soon as your eGFR is 20 or lower. But your doctor may refer you for evaluation before your eGFR is 20. **Ask your doctor about a referral when your eGFR is 30 or less.**

### Evaluation

Before you get a transplant, you will meet with a transplant team and go through an evaluation process. The transplant team will do many screenings and tests to see if you would be a good candidate for a transplant. They will check blood and tissue types of you and your donor to be sure your donor's kidney is a good match for you (compatible).

## What are my transplant options?

If you are considering getting a transplant, you have two options for where your donor kidney will come from: a living donor or a deceased donor.

## Living Donor Transplant

A living donor kidney transplant is surgery where doctors give you a kidney from a person who is alive and chooses to donate one of their two healthy kidneys. A living donor transplant has different names based on how the donation happens:

### Directed donation

This is the most common type - the kidney is from a living donor who you know.

### Non-directed donation

The kidney is from someone who does not name a specific recipient but wants to donate to anyone - this is also called an "altruistic" donation.

### Paired exchange donation ("kidney swap")

This option may happen if you and your living donor are not blood or tissue type compatible with each other. You and your donor will be paired with another donor-recipient pair who better matches you and your donor. The other pair may be people you don't know, such as people from another area of the country.

### Transplant voucher program

This newer option allows your willing, yet incompatible donor, to donate to someone else at a time that's best for them. Their donation creates a voucher (credit) for you when you need a kidney in the future. Check if your transplant center offers this program and ask if this would work for you and your donor.

## Deceased Donor Transplant

A deceased donor kidney transplant is a surgery where doctors give you a kidney from an organ donor who has died. The average wait time is 3-5 years for a deceased donor's kidney and may be longer or shorter in some parts of the country.

## Important Note

Going through a transplant can feel time-consuming, tiring and stressful. Yet some people have added barriers while going through this process. Black and Hispanic or Latino Americans are less likely to be added to the waitlist for a preemptive transplant, less likely to be referred for evaluation and less likely to receive a living donor kidney transplant. While many factors contribute to these added barriers, you can be your own champion. Start the conversation today with your doctor about these transplant options to learn if you may qualify.

## Why is it important to learn about a transplant?

A transplant can be a life-changing surgery for you. However, conversations about this treatment often do not happen until after "crashing" into dialysis. At this point, you may feel overwhelmed about your new diagnosis and this big decision.

By learning about the transplant option, you can be more informed about this treatment and feel more comfortable talking to your doctor about this at an earlier stage of kidney disease. You and your doctor can discuss if you are a good candidate and steps you can take to raise your chances of having a successful transplant.
