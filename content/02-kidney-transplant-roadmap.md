# Kidney Transplant Roadmap

## Your Journey Step-by-Step

A kidney transplant happens in stages. Knowing what to expect can help you feel more prepared and less worried. Here's the roadmap for your transplant journey.

## Step 1: Talk with Your Doctor

**When to start:** When your eGFR is 25-35

**What to do:** Start the conversation about transplant options. Ask your nephrologist about:

- Whether you're a candidate for transplant
- When you should be referred to a transplant center
- What steps you need to take

**Important:** If your eGFR is 30 or less, ask about getting a referral to a transplant center. Don't wait until you need dialysis.

## Step 2: Get Referred to a Transplant Center

**How it works:**

- Your nephrologist or dialysis social worker can refer you
- Or you can call a transplant center yourself
- You can look at more than one center to find the best fit

**What to do:** Contact the transplant center to start your evaluation. You'll need:

- Your medical records
- Insurance information
- A list of your current medications

## Step 3: Complete Your Evaluation

**How long it takes:** Usually 3 months or less

**What happens:** The transplant team will:

- Review your medical history
- Run tests to check your health
- Make sure you're ready for surgery
- Check that you have support at home
- Review your insurance and finances

**Tests you might have:**

- Blood work and lab tests
- Heart and lung tests
- Mental health evaluation
- Dental exam
- Other health screenings

## Step 4: Join the Waitlist (or Find a Living Donor)

### If You're Waiting for a Deceased Donor

- **Average wait time:** 3 to 5 years
- You'll stay on dialysis while waiting
- Keep all your contact information updated
- Stay as healthy as possible
- Answer the phone immediately when the center calls

### If You Have a Living Donor

- **Average wait time:** 3 to 6 months
- Faster process than waiting for a deceased donor
- Surgery can be scheduled ahead of time
- Better outcomes and longer kidney survival

## Step 5: The Transplant Surgery

**The surgery:**

- Takes about 3 to 4 hours
- Your old kidneys usually stay in place
- The new kidney is placed in your lower abdomen
- You'll be asleep during the surgery

**After surgery:**

- You'll stay in the hospital for 3 to 5 days
- Doctors will watch your new kidney closely
- You'll start taking anti-rejection medications right away
- Pain is normal but can be managed

## Step 6: Recovery and Life After Transplant

**First 6 weeks:**

- You'll see your transplant team regularly
- Blood tests to check how your kidney is working
- Learn how to take your medications correctly
- Watch for signs of rejection or infection

**3 months after surgery:**

- Most people are feeling much better
- You'll still need regular check-ups
- Continue taking medications as prescribed

**Long-term:**

- Take anti-rejection medications for life
- See your transplant team regularly
- Follow a healthy lifestyle
- Stay in touch with your care team

## Staying Healthy While You Wait

While you're on the waitlist or waiting for a living donor:

- Keep all doctor appointments
- Take medications as prescribed
- Stay active if your doctor says it's okay
- Eat a kidney-friendly diet
- Keep your phone charged and nearby
- Update the transplant center if you move or change your phone number

## Your Support Team

You don't have to go through this alone. Your team includes:

- Your transplant coordinator
- Transplant surgeons and doctors
- Nurses and nurse practitioners
- Social workers
- Financial coordinators
- Dietitians
- Pharmacists
- Your family and friends

## Questions to Ask Your Team

- How long will my evaluation take?
- What tests do I need?
- How long is the waitlist at this center?
- What happens after I'm listed?
- What should I do while I wait?
- How will I know when a kidney is available?

Remember, every person's journey is different. Your transplant team will guide you through each step and answer all your questions.
