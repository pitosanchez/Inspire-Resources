## What to Ask the Transplant Center

When you're looking at transplant centers, ask these questions:

## Getting a Referral

There are a few ways to get started with a transplant center:

**Option 1: Doctor Referral**
- Your nephrologist can refer you
- They'll send your medical records to the center

**Option 2: Dialysis Center Referral**
- The social worker at your dialysis center can help
- They often know the local transplant centers well

**Option 3: Self-Referral**
- You can call a transplant center directly
- Ask to speak to a transplant coordinator
- They'll tell you what you need to get started

## Working with Multiple Centers

**You can apply to more than one transplant center!** This might help you:

- Get listed faster if one center has a shorter waitlist
- Find a center that accepts you if another doesn't
- Compare different programs and outcomes

Just make sure to tell each center that you're looking at other options too.

## After You're Listed

Once a transplant center accepts you:

- They'll add you to the national waitlist if needed
- They'll give you instructions on what to do while you wait
- You'll have regular check-ins with your coordinator
- Keep all your contact information updated
- Stay as healthy as possible

## Your Relationship with the Center

Remember, the transplant center is your partner in this journey. They want you to succeed. Don't be afraid to:

- Ask questions when you don't understand something
- Speak up if something doesn't feel right
- Call your coordinator when you have concerns
- Bring someone with you to appointments for support

Your transplant team is there to help you every step of the way.
