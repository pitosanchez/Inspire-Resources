# Eligibility Requirements

## Most People Are Accepted

The good news is: **most people who apply for a kidney transplant are accepted onto the waitlist!** Transplant centers want to help as many people as possible. Don't assume you won't qualify - let the transplant team decide.

## What Transplant Centers Look For

Transplant centers evaluate several areas to make sure you can handle the transplant and care for your new kidney. Here's what they consider:

## Medical Health

Transplant centers need to know you're healthy enough for surgery. They'll check:

### Cancer-Free Status
- You need to be cancer-free
- If you've had cancer, an oncologist (cancer doctor) must clear you
- Some cancers need to be in remission for a certain amount of time

### No Active Infections
- Active infections need to be treated first
- The center wants to make sure you won't have serious infections after transplant

### Heart, Lung, and Circulation Health
- Your heart needs to be strong enough for surgery
- Your lungs need to work well
- Good blood circulation is important

### Controlled Chronic Conditions
- Other health problems like diabetes or high blood pressure need to be under control
- You'll need to show you can manage these conditions

## Lifestyle Factors

How you live your life matters for transplant success:

### Substance Use
- You can't have an active substance use disorder
- If you've struggled with this, centers may want to see you're in recovery
- They want to make sure you can care for yourself after transplant

### Healthy Weight (BMI)
- Being overweight can make surgery riskier
- Each center has different BMI limits
- If your BMI is too high, they may ask you to lose weight first

### Medical Compliance
- You need to show you can follow medical instructions
- This means taking medications as prescribed
- Going to appointments regularly
- Following your doctor's advice

### Smoking
- Most centers require you to quit smoking
- Smoking makes transplant surgery more dangerous
- It also hurts your new kidney's health

## Support System

You'll need help after your transplant. Centers want to know you have:

### A Reliable Caregiver
- Someone who can help you after surgery
- This person should be available for at least a few weeks
- They'll help with medications, appointments, and daily tasks

### Transportation
- A way to get to appointments and the hospital
- You'll have many appointments, especially at first
- Centers want to make sure you can get there

### Stable Housing
- A safe place to live and recover
- Somewhere you can rest and heal
- Access to clean water and proper facilities

### Updated Contact Information
- A working phone number where you can always be reached
- Current address
- Emergency contact information
- If you move, you must update the transplant center immediately

## Financial Considerations

Transplant centers need to know you can afford the care:

### Health Insurance Coverage
- You need insurance that covers transplant and medications
- Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance often cover transplants
- Centers have financial coordinators to help you understand your coverage

### Ability to Afford Medications
- You'll need anti-rejection medications for life
- These can be expensive
- Centers will help you find financial assistance programs

### Financial Coordinator Help
- Every center has someone to help with insurance and costs
- They can find programs to help pay for medications
- They'll work with you on payment plans if needed

### Access to Support Resources
- Centers can connect you with programs that help with:
  - Medication costs
  - Transportation
  - Housing if needed
  - Food assistance

## Don't Meet All Requirements? Don't Give Up!

**Important:** If you don't meet every requirement right now, you still have options:

### Many Things Can Be Improved

- **Weight** - You can work with doctors and dietitians to lose weight
- **Smoking** - You can quit with help and support
- **Infections** - Most infections can be treated
- **Other health problems** - Many conditions can be better controlled

### Different Centers Have Different Rules

- One center might say no, but another might say yes
- Each center sets their own criteria
- It's worth looking at more than one center

### Get Help to Meet Requirements

- Talk to your doctor about improving your health
- Ask about programs to help you quit smoking
- Work with a dietitian on healthy eating
- Get support for substance use if needed
- Build your support network

### Take It Step by Step

- Focus on one thing at a time
- Ask your doctors what's most important to work on
- Set small goals you can achieve
- Celebrate your progress

## The Evaluation Process

When you go through evaluation, the transplant team will:

1. Review your medical history
2. Do tests and screenings
3. Check each area (medical, lifestyle, support, financial)
4. Talk with you about any concerns
5. Help you understand what you might need to work on

## What Happens After Evaluation

### If You're Accepted

- You'll be added to the waitlist
- You'll get instructions on what to do next
- Your coordinator will keep in touch
- Stay healthy and keep appointments

### If You Need to Make Changes First

- The team will tell you what to work on
- They'll help you make a plan
- You can be re-evaluated after you make improvements
- Don't give up - many people get accepted on a second try

### If One Center Says No

- Try another center
- Ask why you weren't accepted
- Work on those areas
- Reapply when you're ready

## Questions to Ask

- What are your specific requirements?
- What do I need to work on to qualify?
- Are there programs to help me meet requirements?
- What happens if I don't meet all requirements?
- Can I reapply later if I improve?
- Do you have resources to help me?

Remember: **Most people who apply are accepted.** The transplant center wants to help you succeed. Work with them, be honest about your situation, and don't be afraid to ask for help meeting the requirements.
