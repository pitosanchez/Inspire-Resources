## Types of Living Donation

### Directed Donation

**What it is:**
- You choose who receives your kidney
- Usually someone you know: family member, friend, or someone in your community

**How it works:**
- You and the recipient are evaluated
- If you're both approved and compatible, the transplant happens
- You give your kidney directly to the person you chose

### Paired Exchange (Kidney Swap)

**What it is:**
- You want to donate to someone, but you're not a direct match
- Another pair has the same situation
- You swap - you donate to their recipient, their donor gives to your recipient

**Example:**
- You want to donate to your friend, but your blood types don't match
- Someone else wants to donate to their family member, but they don't match
- You donate to their family member, and they donate to your friend
- Both recipients get transplants!

**Benefits:**
- More people can find matches
- You can still help the person you care about
- More transplants happen overall

### Altruistic Donation

**What it is:**
- You donate to help anyone in need
- You don't know the recipient personally
- You want to help someone get a transplant

**How it helps:**
- You can start a "chain" where your donation helps multiple people
- More kidneys become available for everyone
- You save a life and help many others

## The Donation Surgery

### Before Surgery

**You'll prepare by:**

**What happens:**

- Many centers use minimally invasive surgery (smaller cuts, faster recovery)

### Recovery in the Hospital

**What to expect:**
- Stay in the hospital for 1 to 3 days
- Pain is normal but can be managed
- You'll be up and walking soon after surgery
- The medical team will watch you closely
- You'll learn how to care for yourself at home

### Recovery at Home

**The first few weeks:**
- Rest is important
- You'll have some pain and soreness
