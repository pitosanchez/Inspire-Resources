## Terms You Should Know

Understanding transplant terminology can help you feel more confident during your journey. Here are common terms you'll hear and what they mean.

## A

**ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase)** - A blood test that checks how well your liver is working.

**Anti-rejection Medications** - Medications you take after transplant to prevent your body from rejecting your new kidney. You'll need to take these for life.

**AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase)** - Another blood test that checks liver function.

## B

**Biopsy** - A small sample of tissue taken from your kidney to check for problems like rejection. The sample is looked at under a microscope.

**Blood Type** - Your blood type (A, B, AB, or O) matters for matching. You need a kidney from someone with a compatible blood type.

**BMI (Body Mass Index)** - A measure of body fat based on your height and weight. Transplant centers often have BMI requirements.

## C

**Caregiver** - Someone who helps you before, during, and after your transplant. This person supports you with medications, appointments, and daily tasks.

**Creatinine** - A waste product in your blood that your kidneys remove. High creatinine levels mean your kidneys aren't working well.

**Crossmatch** - A blood test to see if your body will reject a specific donor's kidney. A negative crossmatch means you're compatible.

## D

**Dialysis** - A treatment that does the work your kidneys can't do anymore. It removes waste and extra fluid from your blood. You can have hemodialysis (at a center or home) or peritoneal dialysis (at home).

**Deceased Donor** - Someone who has passed away and chose to donate their organs. Their kidney goes to someone on the waiting list.

**Directed Donation** - When a living donor chooses to give their kidney directly to someone they know.

## E

**eGFR (Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate)** - A measure of how well your kidneys are working. It's calculated from your creatinine level, age, sex, and race. Lower numbers mean your kidneys aren't working as well.

**Evaluation** - The process of checking if you're healthy enough for a transplant. You'll have many tests and appointments during evaluation.

## F

**Financial Coordinator** - A person at the transplant center who helps you understand insurance coverage and costs. They can also help find financial assistance programs.

## G

**Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)** - See eGFR.

**Graft** - The transplanted kidney. Medical professionals sometimes call your new kidney a "graft."

## H

**Hemodialysis** - A type of dialysis that filters your blood through a machine. Usually done at a dialysis center, but can be done at home.

**HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen)** - Proteins on your cells that help your immune system tell the difference between your own cells and foreign cells. Better HLA matching can improve transplant success.

## I

**Immunosuppression** - Treatment to lower your immune system so it won't attack your new kidney. This is done with anti-rejection medications.

**Incision** - The cut made during surgery. You'll have an incision from your transplant surgery.

**Incompatible** - When a donor and recipient don't match well enough for direct donation. They might still be able to help through paired exchange.

## K

**Kidney Function** - How well your kidneys work to clean your blood and remove waste. Measured by tests like eGFR and creatinine.

## L

**Listed** - When you're added to the national waiting list for a deceased donor kidney. Also called "being on the list."

**Living Donor** - A healthy person who gives one of their kidneys to someone who needs a transplant. This person can be a family member, friend, or stranger.

**Living Donor Transplant** - Getting a kidney from a living person instead of waiting for a deceased donor.

## M

**Match** - When a donor and recipient are compatible. This means the donor's kidney is likely to work well in the recipient's body.

**Medicare** - Government health insurance that covers transplant and some medications for people with end-stage kidney disease.

**Medication Compliance** - Taking your medications exactly as prescribed. This is very important after transplant.

## N

**Nephrologist** - A doctor who specializes in kidney disease. Also called a kidney doctor.

**Non-Directed Donor** - A living donor who donates to someone they don't know. Also called an altruistic donor.

## O

**OPTN (Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network)** - The national organization that manages the transplant system and waiting list.

**Organ Rejection** - When your immune system attacks your new kidney. This can be treated if caught early. Anti-rejection medications help prevent rejection.

## P

**Paired Exchange** - When two donor-recipient pairs swap kidneys. Your donor gives to someone else, and that person's donor gives to you. Also called a kidney swap.

**Peritoneal Dialysis** - A type of dialysis done at home. Fluid is put into your abdomen through a catheter, and it cleans your blood.

**Post-Transplant** - After your transplant surgery.

**Pre-Transplant** - Before your transplant surgery.

**Pre-emptive Transplant** - Getting a transplant before you need dialysis. This often has better outcomes.

## R

**Recipient** - The person who receives a transplanted kidney. That's you!

**Rejection** - See Organ Rejection.

## S

**Social Worker** - A person at the transplant center who helps with emotional support, insurance, finances, and connecting you with resources.

**Surgery** - The transplant operation itself, which takes about 3 to 4 hours.

## T

**Tissue Typing** - Testing to see how well a donor and recipient match. This includes blood type and HLA matching.

**Transplant Center** - A hospital with a special team that does transplants and provides transplant care.

**Transplant Coordinator** - Your main contact person at the transplant center. They coordinate your care and answer your questions.

**Transplant Surgeon** - The doctor who performs your transplant surgery.

**Transplant Team** - All the healthcare workers who help with your transplant, including doctors, nurses, coordinators, social workers, and others.

## U

**UNOS (United Network for Organ Sharing)** - The organization that manages the national organ transplant waiting list under contract with the federal government.

## W

**Waitlist** - The national list of people waiting for a deceased donor kidney. Also called the waiting list.

**Waiting Time** - How long you've been on the waitlist. This affects your priority for getting a kidney.

**Warm Ischemia Time** - The time between when a kidney is removed from a donor and when it's cooled for transport. Shorter times are better.

## Understanding Medical Terms

**Don't be afraid to ask:** If you hear a word you don't understand, ask your transplant team to explain it. They want you to understand everything.

**Write it down:** Keep a notebook and write down new terms and their meanings. This helps you remember them.

**Use simple language:** Ask your team to explain things in simple terms. They're happy to do this.

**Bring someone:** Having a friend or family member at appointments can help - they might remember terms you forget.

## Common Phrases You'll Hear

**"You're a good candidate"** - The transplant team thinks you're likely to do well with a transplant.

**"We're listing you"** - You're being added to the national waitlist.

**"The call"** - When the transplant center calls to say a kidney is available for you.

**"Compatible"** - A good match between you and a donor.

**"Your numbers look good"** - Your test results are in a healthy range.

**"Stay compliant"** - Keep taking your medications exactly as prescribed.

**"Watch for rejection"** - Be aware of signs that your body might be attacking your new kidney.

## Remember

Medical terms can be overwhelming, but don't worry. Your transplant team will explain everything. **The most important thing is that you understand what's happening with your health**, not that you know every medical term.

If you don't understand something, ask! Your team wants you to feel confident and informed throughout your transplant journey.
