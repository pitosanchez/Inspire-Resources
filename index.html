          <p class="paragraph">
            At <strong>Inspire Kidney Transplant Resources</strong>, we believe
            that <strong>everyone</strong> deserves a fair chance at receiving a
            life-saving kidney transplant. However, we also recognize that many
            people, especially those from
            <strong>Black, Brown, and underserved communities</strong>, face
            serious obstacles when trying to access kidney care.
          </p>

          <p class="paragraph">
            These barriers include
            <strong
              >racial bias in healthcare, financial struggles, lack of reliable
              transportation, food and housing insecurity, and limited access to
              medical information.</strong
            >
            Many people are not given the same opportunities to get evaluated
            for a transplant because of these challenges. This is
            <strong>not fair</strong>, and we are here to change that.
          </p>

          <p class="paragraph">
            Our goal is to provide
            <strong
              >easy-to-understand education, one-on-one patient support, and
              strong community partnerships</strong
            >
            to help break down these barriers. By doing this, we empower people
            with the tools and knowledge they need to navigate the complicated
            transplant process with confidence.
          </p>

          <h2>How We Help</h2>

          <p class="paragraph">
            We work with
            <strong
              >trusted doctors, hospitals, and community organizations</strong
            >
            to design programs that make kidney transplant access more
            <strong>fair and equal</strong> for everyone. One of our most
            important programs is the
            <strong>Community Health Worker (CHW) initiative</strong>.
          </p>

          <p class="paragraph">
            Our CHWs are trained professionals who help
            <strong
              >patients and families understand their transplant options,
              connect them with doctors, and provide support every step of the
              way</strong
            >. They assist with:
          </p>

          <ul class="paragraph">
            <li>
              ✅ <strong>Screening for barriers</strong> – helping patients
              figure out what challenges they may face in getting a transplant.
            </li>

            </li>
            <li>
              ✅ <strong>Fighting provider bias</strong> – identifying unfair
              treatment in healthcare and advocating for equal opportunities.
            </li>
            <li>
              ✅
              <strong>Helping with transportation & medication access</strong> –
              ensuring patients can get to doctor appointments and afford
              necessary medications.
